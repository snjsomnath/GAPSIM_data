GAPSIM (Gothenburg Activity-based Population Simulator)

## Overview
GAPSIM_data is a repository for the GAPSIM (Gothenburg Activity-based Population Simulator) project. GAPSIM is a comprehensive simulation tool designed to model and analyze the activity patterns and mobility behaviors of the population in Gothenburg, Sweden. This simulator aims to provide detailed insights into urban planning, transportation systems, and environmental impact assessments.

## Features
- **Population Synthesis**: Generates a synthetic population reflecting real-world demographics, including individuals, households, and their relationships.
- **Activity Simulation**: Models daily activity schedules and mobility patterns for each individual in the synthetic population.
- **Transportation Modeling**: Simulates various modes of transportation and their interactions within the urban environment.
- **Environmental Impact Assessment**: Analyzes the environmental impact of different transportation scenarios and urban planning decisions.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large-scale simulations with efficient data processing and storage.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- **data/**: Contains the raw and processed data used in the simulation.
- **models/**: Includes pre-trained models for various simulation components.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model development.
- **docs/**: Documentation for the project, including usage instructions and technical details.
